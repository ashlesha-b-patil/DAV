ğŸ§ª EDA: Air Quality Dataset

# Step 1: Load necessary libraries (base R is mostly enough for EDA)
# airquality is an inbuilt dataset, so we just load it
data("airquality")      # Load dataset
df <- airquality        # Assign to a variable

# Step 2: View basic structure and first few rows
head(df)                # View first few rows
str(df)                 # Structure: variable types and summary

# Step 3: Check for missing values (NA)
colSums(is.na(df))      # Count of NA values in each column

# Step 4: Handle missing values
# Option 1: Remove rows with NA
df_clean <- na.omit(df)

# Option 2: Impute with column means (if needed instead of omitting)
# df$Ozone[is.na(df$Ozone)] <- mean(df$Ozone, na.rm = TRUE)
# df$Solar.R[is.na(df$Solar.R)] <- mean(df$Solar.R, na.rm = TRUE)

# Step 5: Summary statistics
summary(df_clean)       # Min, Max, Mean, Median, etc.

# Step 6: Scatter Plot - Temperature vs Ozone
plot(df_clean$Temp, df_clean$Ozone,
     main = "Ozone vs Temperature",
     xlab = "Temperature (F)",
     ylab = "Ozone (ppb)",
     col = "blue", pch = 16)

# Step 7: Histogram - Distribution of Ozone
hist(df_clean$Ozone,
     main = "Ozone Level Distribution",
     xlab = "Ozone (ppb)",
     col = "lightgreen", border = "black")

# Step 8: Boxplot - Ozone by Month
boxplot(Ozone ~ Month, data = df_clean,
        main = "Ozone Levels by Month",
        xlab = "Month", ylab = "Ozone (ppb)",
        col = "lightblue")

# Step 9: Boxplot - Temperature by Month
boxplot(Temp ~ Month, data = df_clean,
        main = "Temperature by Month",
        xlab = "Month", ylab = "Temperature (F)",
        col = "lightpink")

# Step 10: Barplot - Average Wind Speed by Month
avg_wind <- tapply(df_clean$Wind, df_clean$Month, mean)

barplot(avg_wind,
        main = "Average Wind Speed by Month",
        xlab = "Month",
        ylab = "Average Wind (mph)",
        col = "orange")
